Language Experts Fail to **Identify** AI-Written Texts

Even experts in **linguistics** are unable to tell if research **summaries** are written by artificial intelligence (AI) or humans, a study found.

Two US researchers asked 72 **linguists** and journal editors to look at short summaries of research, and identify which ones were written by the ChatGPT chatbot.

The experts were only able to correctly identify articles written by ChatGPT 39% of the time, said researchers Matt Kessler of the University of South Florida and J. Elliott Casal of the University of Memphis.

The experts used various ways to study the texts, but they were "largely unsuccessful" in identifying AI writing as being different from human writing, Kessler and Casal wrote in *Research Methods in Applied Linguistics*.

When they were asked how they decided which texts were written by AI, the experts gave "very logical reasons," but were not **accurate** or **consistent**, Kessler said.

The researchers said the study showed that ChatGPT can write short texts "just as well as most humans, if not better in some cases."

But they said research summaries are short and simple pieces of writing.

For a longer piece of writing, AI will sometimes "make up content, making it easier to identify" that AI created it, Kessler said.

Kessler has used the research to change how he gives work to his linguistics students.

He doesn't want them to write short summaries, which "ChatGPT can do quite easily," he says.

Instead, Kessler wants his students to write more about their own experiences, such as how they use an app to learn a foreign language.

An earlier survey of 1,900 Americans by Tooltester found that up to 64% of people could not identify text written by AI.
