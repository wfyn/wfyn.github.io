Wildlife fans watching live video from an Alaskan national park have helped save a man's life.
野生动物迷观看阿拉斯加国家公园的现场视频帮助挽救了一名男子的生命。

Viewers watching live video from Dumpling Mountain in Katmai National Park on September 5 were probably hoping to see **bears**.
9月5日在卡特迈国家公园观看饺子山直播视频的观众可能希望看到熊。Instead, around 3:15 p.m. they saw a man, who looked cold and wet, walk up to the camera and **give the thumbs down signal.**
相反，在下午3点15分左右，他们看到一名看起来又冷又湿的男子走到镜头前，发出了竖起大拇指的信号。

A few minutes later the man returned, and spoke to the camera.
几分钟后，这名男子回来了，对着镜头说话。Because it was windy, the sound was not clear, but the man seemed to be saying the words "lost" and "help me."
因为刮风，声音不清晰，但那人似乎在说“迷路”和“救救我”这两个字。

The area has no cellphone signal, and the weather was bad that day, with wind, rain and **fog**.
该地区没有手机信号，当天天气恶劣，有风雨和雾。

People watching the video on Explore.org **posted** **comments** saying the man **was in trouble**, and **staff at the website** then **contacted** the National Park Service.
在 Explore.org 上观看视频的人发表评论说这名男子遇到了麻烦，该网站的工作人员随后联系了国家公园管理局。

The park sent a team to **look for** the **hiker**, and by 6:48 p.m. they found him — still near the camera — and they were able to take him safely off the mountain.
公园派出了一个团队寻找徒步旅行者，到下午6点48分，他们找到了他 - 仍然在相机附近 - 他们能够将他安全带下山。

Katmai National Park has seven cameras, which are used to show **live video** of the park's scenery and wildlife.
卡特迈国家公园有七个摄像头，用于显示公园风景和野生动物的实时视频。People often watch the videos to see the park's bears, with over 2,000 of the animals believed to live in the park.
人们经常观看视频，看看公园里的熊，据信有超过2000只动物生活在公园里。

The park is **also well-known for** its Fat Bear Week, an online competition held every October, in which people vote for the fattest bear of the year.
该公园还以其肥熊周而闻名，这是每年十月举行的在线比赛，人们投票选出年度最胖的熊。Bears need to get fat before winter, and at this time of year people enjoy watching live video of the bears catching salmon to eat.
熊需要在冬天之前变胖，每年的这个时候，人们都喜欢观看熊捕捉鲑鱼吃的直播视频。

However, on the day the **hiker** **got lost** in early September, he was very lucky, because only a few people were watching when he spoke to the camera.
然而，在9月初徒步旅行者迷路的那天，他非常幸运，因为当他对着镜头说话时，只有少数人在看。
